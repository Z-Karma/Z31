The thin piece is the reinforcement bracket that helps to keep the rubber from sagging. 
On the original flaps, it is molded within the rubber of the flap.

The bracket can be cut from 1.60mm aluminum. 
The original method of fastening was to use push in plastic retainers that passed thru the bracket and stuck into the headlight bucket assy. For these replacements, 
I tapped the in the headlight bucket assy for M6 thread and used The same common M6 fasteners found elsewhere on the car.

The flap material can be made from most any flexible material. 
I chose weather resistant EPDM rubber, McMaster-Carr PN 8610K83
